  # The CLI inside the app; `auroval-agent install` copies the app to
  # /Applications and notes that Homebrew installed it, so the app's own
  # updater stays off and `brew upgrade` does it.

  # No postflight: the app is notarized, so Gatekeeper runs it with the
  # quarantine flag, and `auroval-agent install` drops the flag from the copy
  # it installs. (Homebrew deprecated Ruby flight blocks in taps.)

  # Not on upgrade: brew runs `uninstall` for every upgrade, and that would
  # take the running host and its pairings down. `auroval-agent uninstall`
  # removes it all; zap is for `brew uninstall --zap`.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Alpha. Install Auroval.app with the daemon and agents (asks for your
    password; run it again after every brew upgrade, since the installed
    copy is what runs):
      auroval-agent install
    Then, once, turn Auroval on under Accessibility and Screen Recording
    when macOS asks (the Auroval menu-bar item asks, one at a time). No
    restart needed.
    Releases are signed with a Developer ID and notarized, so these stay
    granted across updates.

    Let a client pair:   sudo auroval-agent pair
    Remove it all:       auroval-agent uninstall
  EOS
