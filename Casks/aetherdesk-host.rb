  binary "aetherdesk-host-#{version}-arm64-macos/aether-agent"

  # No postflight: the binary is notarized, so Gatekeeper runs it with the
  # quarantine flag, and `aether-agent install` drops the flag from the copy
  # it installs. (Homebrew deprecated Ruby flight blocks in taps.)

  # Not on upgrade: brew runs `uninstall` for every upgrade, and that would
  # take the running host and its pairings down. `aether-agent uninstall`
  # removes it all; zap is for `brew uninstall --zap`.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Alpha. Install the daemon and agents (asks for your password; run it
    again after every brew upgrade, since the installed copy is what runs):
      aether-agent install
    Then, once, grant Screen Recording and Accessibility to
      /Library/Application Support/AetherDesk/aether-agent
    in System Settings → Privacy & Security, then restart the agent:
      aether-agent restart
    Releases are signed with a Developer ID and notarized, so these stay
    granted across updates.

    Let a client pair:   sudo aether-agent pair
    Remove it all:       aether-agent uninstall
